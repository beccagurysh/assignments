# Final Reflection

Data Science has provided a new window into understanding the world and the human systems that contribute to it. New systems in data science allow for huge amounts of data to be processed in ways that can provide models for human systems ranging from traffic patterns to economic development. 

One of the first pieces of the revolution in data science is in new methods to collect data. As Sinan Aral said, “Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.” One example of this is the night time lights data used in project five. By gathering data about the amount of light that can be seen from space at night, researchers can make estimates about the population level of development in an area. This type of data collection can increase understanding of the world by giving researchers access to new types of information.

The next part of the revolution in data science is the ability to process information in new ways. One of the most exciting ways to do this is through neural networks and machine learning. An interesting example of this is Duolingo using a machine learning algorithm to find out what notification will get a user to complete lessons based on how effective similar messages have been in the past. Another example is researchers at the University of Manchester creating a machine learning algorithm that can predict the severity of traffic in a region. These applications are just scratching the surface of what can be done with data science.

Many researchers hope to use data science to predict changes in the economy. Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen once described the economy as an evolutionary system. This may seem like it could be difficult to predict, however the use of data science to model evolutionary systems has been done before. Dr. Ahmed Elgammal was able to use a neural network designed to create original works of art to model how art styles evolve over time. A similar process could be used to model economic evolution.

Improvements in data science have drastically improved our ability to understand and predict the world. As technology continues to advance researchers will continue to have more and more insight into the world and how human systems shape it. Using new ways to collect and process information, questions that were once considered too big to answer can be answered.
