# How Doulingo Decideds What Reminders to Send Out

The language learning app DuoLingo is known for its persistent lesson reminders that it sends out to encourage users to continue learning. Up until recently these messages were picked randomly from a list and sent out to users with no further thought. Recently DuoLingo decided they probably would get more engagement if these notifications were tailored to each user based on how often they use the app and what language they are learning. This year the company published a paper detailing the algorithms they used to find the notifications that would be most encouraging to their users. 

The first attempt just used a Bandit algorithm to identify and send the best notifications. Bandit algorithms experiment by testing out all possible options and collecting data on which options performed the best. In this case, which notifications lead to users completing a lesson. Then the algorithm continued to only send the notifications that yielded the best results. This led to three issues. Consistent users, especially those who had long running streaks, a count of how many days in a row a user has completed one or more lessons, will click on almost any notification that they are given. This means that the algorithm favored the types of messages that are only sent to frequent users and did not collect enough information about the messages sent to occasional users. Different messages also had different levels of effectiveness based on what language the user was trying to learn. When every language went into the same data pool the messages that were effective for the most popular languages won out. The algorithm also always sent the same messages which became an issue when the once effective reminders became boring to the users so they stopped paying attention.

The first two issues were addressed by dividing the users into groups based both on frequency of use and the language that they were learning. The third issue was much more difficult to address. DouLingo modified their Bandit algorithm to take into account which notifications each user had already received. They did this by using the same model the company had already been using to determine how much of a language a user would forget over different amounts of time. This ‘forgetting curve’ allowed DouLingo to keep their reminders exciting to their users without having to constantly write new ones. After making these changes and launching the new system, the company reported increased engagement after only a few weeks of tailored notifications.
