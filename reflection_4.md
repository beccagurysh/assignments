# AI Generated Art

In March of 2019, the first ever solo show for an artificial intelligence ‘artist’ was held. The art in this show was created by an artificial intelligence created by Dr. Ahmed Elgammal. The art was created using a creative advisory network (CAN). This neural network created by Dr. Elgammal was adapted from earlier art creation programs called generative adversarial networks (GANs).

GANs are comprised of a set of neural networks the first, called the generator, creates a new piece of art based on patterns the network observes from a provided gallery of portraits. The second network, called the discerner, compares this new piece of art to the portraits to determine if the patterns are recognizable in this new piece. This system caused some uproar in the art world. Many people worried that the network drew too much from the reference pieces and the product was too similar to be considered a new work. This is why Dr. Elgammal created CAN.

CAN replaces the second step that checks for similarity with one that introduces new elements. This process mirrors the way that art styles organically over time, adding new features and techniques to old practices. This allows for computer generated art that is both original and visually appealing. According to Elgammal most people are unable to differentiate between his CAN art and traditional art pieces of a similar style. This is great for those interested in expanding the use of AI and worrisome for those who think the introduction of this technology will have a negative impact on the art world.
