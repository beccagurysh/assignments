# Using Data from Twitter to Predict Traffic

Short term traffic prediction is an important part of maintaining road safety and efficiency. Current traffic prediction models use machine learning algorithms and banks of data containing past traffic patterns and disruptions in the area. Some more advanced predictors also factor in the predicted weather and compare the conditions of the time they are predicting to past moments. This data can make predictions even more accurate and help drivers find safer and less congested roads. However, this data cannot accurately predict every situation.

Incidents such as accidents, damage to roadways, and events such as protests and parades can also have effects on traffic. These disruption to traffic flow can be difficult to see coming and may not always be properly reported to predictive organizations accurately and in a timely manner. This can throw off predictions and cause divers to receive false or even dangerous information. Fortunately, many twitter accounts are dedicated to updating their followers on the conditions of roads in the area. In an attempt to better predict traffic Researchers from the University of Manchester conducted a study on the effectiveness of  combining traffic data, weather forecasts, and reports of road disruptions from Twitter to create more accurate short term traffic predictions. 

This research involved creating a neural network to predict short term changes in traffic based on a variety of factors. The historical traffic data was collected from ten traffic sensors along the studyâ€™s test road, Chester Road in Stretford, Greater Manchester. The weather data was collected by the Center for Atmospheric Studies at the University of Manchester. Twitter data was limited to the twitter accounts of Transport for Greater Manchestor and Waze in order to avoid any inaccurate reporting. The data was collected for about three months and the researchers found that the inclusion of Twitter increased the accuracy of short term traffic prediction in the studied area. Expanding this type of reporting could create better traffic prediction for all drivers.
